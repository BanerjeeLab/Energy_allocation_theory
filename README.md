# Energy_allocation_theory
There are two sample codes in this repository. 
downshift_sample.py contains a simulation of our model with a fitting procedure to capture nutrient shift perturbations as seen in Fig. 6 of the paper.
A sample downshift dataset is included in downShift2.csv (Erickson, D. et al. Nature 2017).


hyperosmotic_sample.py contains a simulation of our model under a pressure perturbation to capture qualatative osmotic shock behavior.
The parameters currently set in the simulation correspond to a hyperosmotic shock as seen in Fig. 8.


See comments in the code and the main paper for more information.
